# 🧮 Calculator App in Python

This is a simple **Calculator** application built using **Python (Tkinter GUI)**.  
It supports both **keyboard input** and **mouse input** for entering numbers and operations.  
All essential keyboard functions are fully bound to make the calculator easy and efficient to use.  

This project helped me learn:  
- Designing interactive GUIs with **Tkinter**  
- Handling **mouse and keyboard events** in Python  
- Implementing calculator logic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear, etc.)  
- Binding keyboard keys to GUI buttons
